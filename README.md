This work explores the history and cryptographic *__retirement__* of the MD5 algorithm. It creates poetic farewell to the MD5 hashing function by transforming text inputs into musical requiems.

### The Story of MD5

MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1992 as a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. For over a decade, it was widely used for various security applications and data integrity verification.


Despite its initial widespread adoption, MD5 has been considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use since approximately 2005 ~ 2008. The National Institute of Standards and Technology formally deprecated MD5 for most uses in 2010


### Technical Architecture

MD5 Core consists of three main components:

1. Web Interface: A React-based frontend where users can input text

2. MD5 Hashing: The input text is processed through the MD5 algorithm to generate a 128-bit hash

3. MIDI Composition: The hash is sent via OSC protocol to SuperCollider, which generates a musical composition based on requiem chords. The resulting composition is served over MIDI.

Each hash produces a unique musical piece that reflects the solemn, memorial nature of a funeral mass.
