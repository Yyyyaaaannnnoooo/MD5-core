# MD5

this is a pico live coding environment

it is based on the md5 hashing algorithm

it can take a text of any length and turn it into a 128-bit string. or 32 hex digits.

The hash is than turned into a score, that we are hearing.

now that we established that any text can become a variation of a requiem; what is the purpose of this live coding environment?

I can use Live Coding to tell a story.

And the words of this story will compose its own soundtrack

md5 as an algorithm was "retired" in 2010, as it was not meeting the security standards for criptography

...for long it encrypted, yet, its collision resistance was broken, and therefore unusable for cryptographic purposes

....and so this piece is to say goodbye. A farewell for md5

Ciao md5, we had adventurous and troubling times. And between that flowers resiliently grew up!

Ciao md5, your hashes never met the ocean, yet your name bestows a library.

stifle seagulls still flap their wings

curled laughter

Your name on that rock!
